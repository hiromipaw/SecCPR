## A set of simple rules to communicate safely

## Account security 

A few simple rules can go a long way when it comes to secure your online accounts.

### 1. Use unique passwords. Be creative. Use a password manager.

In many circumstances a password is all that keeps your information secured and private. In many cases this also protects your physical security and that of your colleagues and others close to you.
If you have been using the same passwords along different years or months there is a chance that it has been leaked along the line. You can check [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) for an updated list of compromised services over the years.

Use only unique passwords.

If you want to make a password secure add some randomness. Be a little creative, combine words with number in a way that it is easy to remember. Add spaces and capital letters.

Also it is almost impossible that you can remember all the passwords you use. Therefore you can consider to use a password manager.

### 2. Enable 2-FA for all your accounts (where possible).

2-FA is an authentication method that adds an additional level of security when you login into your account. In practice it only asks for a security code in addition to your password.

To find out more about 2-FA you can visit: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)

### 3. Use a backup solution. Better if encrypted.

There is always a possibility that you can be hacked and have to delete everything on your devices and install everything again. Consider using a backup solution. Better if encrypted. Even better if they adopt a 0-knowledge policy.

0-Knowledge means that all your data is encrypted with a key you only know and the company hosting your files cannot possibly know what you are storing.

We now list a number of cloud backup solutions that use a 0-knowledge policy. Note that this is not an endorsment.
